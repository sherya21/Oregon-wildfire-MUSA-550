## Wildfires

Wildfires, a phenomenon where an uncontrolled fire that burns in the wildland vegetation, has been a growing concern in the US in recent years. For our final project, we will be using machine learning techniques to explore instances of wildfires across Oregon, in the United States.  As wildfires become increasingly common, it is crucial to equip policy-makers and first responders with tools to help better predict areas that are most likely to set ablaze across the State.

The National Interagency Fire Center statistics show that as of Dec. 7, 2023, there have been 53,685 fires this year that have burned nearly 2.61 million acres.

## Methodology
### The Data:
1. [Kaggle fire dataset (1992-2015)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/captcalculator/wildfire-exploratory-analysis)
2. Land cover (1992-2015)
3. [Climatic conditions data (pulled from Copernicus Climate Change Service API)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview)

### Key Questions:
1. How frequently are wildfires occurring across Oregon?
2. What factors most contribute to the start and spread of wildfires in Oregon?
3. Which areas are the most susceptible to future wildfires?
4. What areas have regenerated fuel to burn again in the past and are susceptible to burning in the future?

### Analytical Techniques
1. Exploratory analysis (temporal + spatial)
2. Tensorflow and scikit-learn packages to develop regressions for neural network (ANN)
3. Model fitting and validation (minimization of MSE)

Assessing and predicting factors related to the spread of wildfires across Oregon is multifaceted, including geospatial and feature-related questions.  Because of this, it will be crucial for us to utilise many of the packages and techniques discussed in class.
